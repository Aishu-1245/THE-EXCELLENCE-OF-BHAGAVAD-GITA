                <h3><b>Why to read Gita?</b></h3><br>
                    The Bhagavad Gita offers the fundamentals of life. The book describes the excellence of God, the greatness of Dharma and the superiority of Karma. The Gita explains the profound sense of selfless service.
                    <p>
                        The great Acharya Shankara Bhagavatpadacharya, the reviver of Sanathana Dharma, spoke about the Bhagavad Gita in his <a href="#" id="stotram-link" class="text-amber-700 font-bold hover:underline">Govinda Stotram</a>. He mentioned that one who sincerely listens to and grasps the wisdom of the Gita, who drunk even a drop of the water of the Ganges, and who worships Krishna wholeheartedly, will be protected from the reach of Yama (the lord of death).

                    <p>
                        In the Gita, which consists of 18 chapters and 700 verses (shlokas), Lord Krishna explains the nature of reality, covering topics such as:

Both armies blow their conch shells, creating a tremendous and terrifying sound that signals the ominous and devastating results to come.<br> *<b> (Shloka 28):</b> Arjuna, initially ready for battle, asks Lord Krishna to place his chariot between the two armies so he can see who he must fight. When he sees his own grandfathers, teachers, uncles, and cousins arrayed against him, his confidence shatters and uncertainty sets in.<br> *<b> (Shloka 30):</b> Arjuna becomes completely confused. As stated in Sloka 30, he tells Krishna, I am now unable to stand here any longer. I am forgetting myself, and my mind is reeling. I see only causes of misfortune. <br> * <b> (Shloka 31):</b> This is the critical turning point. Arjuna drops his weapons and directly he states that he is unwilling to fight.

 </div>
<div>
 <h4 class='font-bold text-lg text-amber-800'> Signs of Gunas</h4>
 <li> <b>Shlokas (11-13):</b>When all the gates of the body are illumined by knowledge, know it to be a manifestation of the mode of "goodness"(sattva). When the mode of "passion"(rajas) dominates, the symptoms of greed, exertion(struggle) for physical gain, restlessness, and craving develop. carelessness, inertia(laziness), negligence, and delusion—these are the dominant signs of the mode of "ignorance"(tamas).
<li> <b>Shlokas (14-15):</b> Those who die with predominance(superiority) of sattva reach the pure abodes (which are free from rajas and tamas). Those who die with prevalence of the mode of passion are born among people driven by work, while those dying in the mode of ignorance take birth in the animal kingdom..</li>
 </div>
 <div>
<h4 class='font-bold text-lg text-amber-800'>Results of three Gunas </h4>
<li> <b> Shloka 16 :</b> The fruit of actions(karma phala) performed in the mode of "goodness"(sattva) presents <b>pure results</b>. Actions done in the mode of "passion"(rajas) result in <b>pain</b>, while those performed in the mode of "ignorance"(tamas) result in <b>darkness</b>.</li>
</div>
<div>
    <h4 class='font-bold text-lg text-amber-800'>Arises of Gunas </h4>
<li> <b>Shloka 17: </b>From the mode of "goodness"(sattva) arises <b>knowledge</b>, from the mode of "passion"(rajas) arises <b>greed,</b> and from the mode of "ignorance"(tamas) arise <b>negligence and delusion.</b></li>
</div>
<div>
    <h4 class='font-bold text-lg text-amber-800'>Status of Gunas </h4>
<li> <b> Shloka 18 :</b>Those situated in the mode of "goodness"(sattva) rise <b>high(upward)</b>; those in the mode of "passion"(rajas) stay in the <b>middle</b>; and those in the mode of "ignorance"(tamas) go <b>low(downward)</b>.</li>
<li> <b> Shloka 19 :</b> When wise(jnani) persons see that in all work there is no agent of action other than the three guṇas, and they know lord to be transcendental(eternal) to these guṇas, they attain divine nature.</li>
</div>
 <div> 
    <h4 class='font-bold text-lg text-amber-800'>Characteristics and bondage of Gunas </h4>
    <li> <b> Shloka 21 :</b> Arjuna asks, What are the characteristics of those who have gone beyond the three guṇas? How do they act? How do they go beyond the bondage of the guṇas?</li>
    <li> <b> Shloka 22-23 :</b> Neutrality to the modes: A person who is transcendental to the modes of nature does not dislike them when they appear, nor do they desire them when they are absent. This means they do not hate clarity and knowledge (born of sattva), nor are they bothered by activity and passion (born of rajas), and they do not mind confusion or delusion (born of tamas).</li>
    <li> <b> Shloka 24-25 :</b> Those who are alike in happiness and distress; who are established in the self; who look upon a clod, a stone, and a piece of gold as of equal value; who remain the same amidst pleasant and unpleasant events; who are intelligent; who accept both blame and praise with equanimity; who remain the same in honor and dishonor; who treat both friend and foe alike; and who have abandoned all enterprises, they are said to have risen above the three guṇas.</li>
    <li> <b> Shloka 27 :</b>Those who serve divine with unalloyed devotion rise above the three modes of material nature and come to the level of the formless Brahman(eternal).</li>

 <li> <b>Shloka 1:</b> This introduces the metaphor(comparison between two things) of the <i>Aśvattha tree</i> with its roots above, branches below, and its leaves are the mantras of the vedas. This tree represents the material(physical) world, which is sustained by its spiritual roots—the Supreme Being. One who understands this tree knows the Vedas.</li>
 </div>
 <div>
 <h4 class='font-bold text-lg text-amber-800'>2. The Divine as the Source of All Light</h4>
 <li><b> Shlokas 6 and 12 :</b> Shloka 6 states that Krishna's supreme abode(shelter) is not illuminated(enlighted) by the sun, the moon, or fire. Those who reach this abode(shelter) never return to the material world.</li>
 <li> Shloka 12 clarifies that the splendor(glory) of the sun, the moon, and fire all come from Him. He is the source of all light that illuminates the entire universe.</li>

<li> <b> Shlokas 16 and 17 :</b> Shloka 16 introduces two types of beings: the <i>Kshara</i> (fallible) and the <i>Akshara</i> (infallible). The <i>Kshara</i> are all the living beings in the material world, while the <i>Akshara</i> are those in the spiritual world.</li>
<li> Shloka 17 reveals a third, and highest, being: the <i>Purushottama</i> (the Supreme Person). He is beyond both the <i>Kshara</i> and <i>Akshara</i> and sustains the three worlds. This is a central philosophical point of the chapter.</li>
<li> <b> Shlokas 18-20 :</b> Krishna says that he is transcendental(divine) to both the fallible(kshara) and the infallible(Akshara), and because he is the greatest, He celebrated in the world and in the Vedas as the Supreme Person (Purushottama). Who knows Krishna as the Purushottama, without any doubt, is a knower of everything ("sarvavith").</li>
<li>Anyone who understands this knowledge becomes intelligent and achieves a state of perfection.</li>

 <li>**Knowledge of Passion**: A person sees manifold living beings as separate and unconnected.</li>
<li>**Knowledge of Ignorance**: One is engrossed(absorbed) in a partial concept, mistaking it for the whole truth without reason.</li>
 <li><b>Shlokas (23-25):</b>** Action of Goodness**: Action that is free from attachment and aversion, and done without desire for rewards, is in the mode of goodness.</li>
                        <li>**Action of Passion**: Action that is prompted by selfish desire, enacted with pride, and full of stress, is in the nature of passion.</li>
                        <li>**Action of Ignorance**: Action that is begun out of delusion, without thought to one's own ability, and disregarding consequences, loss, and injury to others.</li>

                        <li>**Performer of Ignorance**: The one performer who is undisciplined, vulgar, stubborn, deceitful(disonest), slothful(lazy), despondent, and a procrastinator.</li>
 <li><b>Shlokas (30-32):</b>**Intellect of Goodness**: This intellect clearly understands what is right and wrong, what is duty and what is not, what to fear and what not to fear, and what leads to bondage versus liberation.</li>
                        <li>**Intellect of Passion**: This intellect is confused. It cannot distinguish between what is righteous(dharma) and unrighteous(adharma), or between right and wrong conduct. </li>

    <li>Only by loving devotion to lord does one come to know who the god in Truth. Then, having come to know Krishna, His devotee enters into full consciousness of Krishna.</li>
